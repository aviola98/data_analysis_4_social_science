#The difference between summarize and mutate is that summarize always reduces the number of lines in a dataset - it is a total or by group aggregation

#percentage by month day hour origin 

flights %>% group_by(month,day,hour,origin) %>%

#it is common to calculate the percentage of the number of observations(rows) in a group comparing it with the total amount of observations
#in this case we calculate the percentage based on the the number of lines

flights %>% group_by(origin) %>%

  mutate(Pct_by_airport=100*(n/sum(n)))


#calculating the percentage of flights by month in each airport 
#in order to do so we can use two grouping processes 
#first, we calculate the number of observations by airport-month
#second, we define the denominator as "airport" in order to calculate the percentage

flights %>% group_by(origin,month) %>%
  tally() %>%
  group_by(origin) %>%
  mutate(Pct_by_month_airport=100*(n/sum(n)))

# if we change the second grouping as month ...

flights %>% group_by(origin,month) %>%
  tally() %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  mutate(Pct_by_month_airport=100*(n/sum(n)))
  
#we get the percentage that represents how much each airport contributed to the number of flights in each month
```

```{r}
#Advanced filters %in%
#calculating the percentage of the distance of each flight by the total distance of all flights with ILM ACK GRR or PSP as destination
flights %>% filter(destination%in%c("ILM","ACK","GRR","PSP")) %>%
  mutate(Pct_distance=100*(distance/sum(distance,na.rm=T)))

#what does %in% do ? Well... if you wanted to write the same code without it , it would be something like this :

flights %>% filter(destination=="ILM"|destination=="ACK"|destination=="GRR"|destination=="PSP") %>%
  mutate(Pct_distance=100*(distance/sum(distance,na.rm=T)))
#so it basically spares you with the work of writing destination == each time in order to filter the airports
```


```{r}
#summary of multiple columns
#summarize only allows you to get the mean of one variable, in order to get the mean of multiple variables we have to insert "across()" inside "summarize()"

                             mean,
                             na.rm=T))

#we can also ask for multiple summaries of the same set of variables inserting "list()"

flights %>% summarize(across(c(departure_time,departure_delay),

                             mean,
